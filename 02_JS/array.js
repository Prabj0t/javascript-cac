// Define an array called myArr containing some numeric values
const myArr = [0, 1, 4, 23, 12, 1, 31];

// Define an array called myHeros containing some string values
const myHeros = ["shaktimaan", "widow"];

// Output the element at index 1 of the myHeros array
console.log(myHeros[1]); // Output: widow

// Explanation:
// - The `const` keyword is used to declare variables that cannot be reassigned.

// Additional Information:
// - Arrays in JavaScript are dynamic, meaning their size can change dynamically by adding or removing elements.
// - The concept of shallow copy refers to copying the array reference, not the actual values.
//   Modifying the copied array will affect the original array if the elements are objects or arrays themselves.
// - JavaScript provides various array methods like `push()`, `pop()`, `splice()`, etc., for manipulating arrays.
// - It's essential to handle array bounds carefully to avoid accessing elements that do not exist, which can lead to errors.
